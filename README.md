# Pongar

Here is a firmware for Fraise/pico that implements a pong game with a rotating lidar, a DMX512 motorized beam projector, and a addressable LED strip.

It uses:

* a LiDAR RPL-C1 rotating distance sensor
* a DMX512 beam projector
* a ws2812 LED strip
* a GD3300 audio file player module

It also implements a simple fixed-point audio-dsp lib, so simple synths can be built for sound fx.
